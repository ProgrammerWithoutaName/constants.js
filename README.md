# constants.js

### Getting Started
The project depends on [Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower) and [Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com). Assuming
you already have **Node.js** installed on your system, run the following command:

```
sudo npm install -g gulp bower
```

Next, clone the repository and install project dependencies:
```bash
# Fetch only the latest commits.
git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:rclanan/constants.js.git

cd constantsjs

bower install
npm install
```
